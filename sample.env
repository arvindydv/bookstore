Task: Backend Developer - Bookstore API Development

Description:
As a backend developer, your task is to create a robust API system for a bookstore application. The application should support two main collections: one for storing book categories and another for storing book details.

Requirements:

Category Collection:

Create a collection to store different categories of books such as culture, heritage, entertainment, etc.
Each category should have a unique identifier and a name.
Book Collection:

Create a collection to store book details including author, title, category, price, and any other relevant information.
Each book entry should have a unique identifier.
The category field should reference the unique identifier of the category it belongs to.
API Endpoints:

Implement an API endpoint to retrieve all books belonging to a particular category when provided with the category name.
Implement an API endpoint to suggest books based on the user's specified budget and preferred categories.
The user should input their total amount and the type of book they want (e.g., culture, heritage).
The endpoint should return a list of books that fall within the user's budget for the specified categories.
Data Validation:

Validate input data to ensure that required fields are provided and have appropriate formats.
Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages in the API responses.

Documentation:

Document the API endpoints, including their input parameters, output formats, and usage examples, to assist frontend developers and other stakeholders.
Performance Optimization:

Optimize the performance of the APIs, especially those dealing with large datasets, to ensure fast response times and scalability.
Scalability:

Design the API system in a scalable manner to handle potential increases in traffic and data volume in the future.

Completion Criteria:

The API system should be fully functional and meet all the specified requirements.
All API endpoints should be thoroughly tested and documented.
The code should be well-organized, maintainable, and adhere to best practices in backend development.
Note: Feel free to use Javascript's Node.js and Express.js for implementing the backend functionality and for database use mongoDB.-
